# hello_world
my first repository

This file is for class :)

My name is David Kump in CSIS 2450 class at SLCC!

GitHub is a source code manager for coding, and allows multiple people to code on a project non-linearly.

The staging area is just a list, or index, that says which files will be committed when a git commit is done

Local repositories are physical, locally-managed repositories into which you can deploy artifacts.

GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers.

By using GIT and GITHUB, programmers can work together on projects without having to be in the same room or place. You can be almost anywhere and code in something to the project, and then use it in the code itself. This makes it so you don't have to ask in person why the changes were made.
